# Docker-Spark-Tutorial
This repo is intended to be a tutorial walkthrough in how to set up and use a Spark cluster running inside Docker containers. 

I assume some familiarity with Docker and its basic commands such as build and run. Everything else will be explained in this file.

We will build up the complexity to eventually a full architecture of a Spark cluster running inside of Docker containers in a 
sequential fashion so as to hopefully build the understanding. The table of contents below shows 
the different architectures we will work through.
